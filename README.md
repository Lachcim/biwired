**Biwired** is a simple-yet-effective Python framework for creating bots for the Wire messaging platform. It hijacks an instance of the Wire web app and uses it to exchange data with the server. Perfect for your friend group, classroom or small enterprise.

## Biwired is ungrounded

Biwired doesn't adhere to Wire Swiss GmbH's idea of what a bot should look like, granting you complete independence from the Wire service registry. Launch your favorite IDE, set up Chrome Headless and within minutes your bot will have joined your conversation. With nothing to tie you down and ground you, your imagination is the only limit.
